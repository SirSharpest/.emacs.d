\section{I recognize but not 100\% understand (AKA squishy bio-stuff)}
\label{sec-1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Haplotypes (I assume this is a pretty straightforward thing for most biologists though right?)
\end{itemize}

\section{What is this? (AKA stuff I haven't heard off)}
\label{sec-2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Nucleotide

\item Haplotype (I put this in twice because it's mentioned so much and changed what I thought I knew and is mentioned in more detail after a while)
\end{itemize}

\section{Grammar?}
\label{sec-3}

\subsection{Page 5}
\label{sec-3-1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Diversity present in the enzymes and small petides in microbial communities \ldots{}
\label{sec-3-1-0-1}
This entire sentence is a little awkward to read, something more like: 
"Diversity in the enzymes and small petides found in microbial communities are a valuable\ldots{} "
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Page 6}
\label{sec-3-2}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The problem of haplotype discover \ldots{} is a post-assembly problem
\label{sec-3-2-0-1}
Could be worded better, feels odd to read

\item There's a [?] that has no references yet to software that can perform these functions
\label{sec-3-2-0-2}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{page 8}
\label{sec-3-3}
There's a few areas on this page that have "\ldots{}" sections that I don't really understand these areas :s 
But I assume this is because they're unfinished so no need to worry 


\section{General thoughts}
\label{sec-4}
I might be wrong, but doesn't anything between two ',' need to not be a requirement for the before and after parts of the sentence? 

\subsection{Page 8}
\label{sec-4-1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Is it worth while expanding upon / reworking the P(h1, h2 | M) so that it's easier to read?
\end{itemize}
All the data is there for the function but has explanation before and after? I could just be nitt picky on this 

\begin{itemize}
\item Maybe I missed something but last paragraph talks about "Wang" but there doesn't seem to be a mention of them before or decent explanation of their work.
\end{itemize}
Good chance that I'm wrong about this so perfectly happy for you to tell me I'm wrong on this

\subsection{Page 9}
\label{sec-4-2}
\subsubsection{More recent methods\ldots{}}
\label{sec-4-2-1}
This section is really nice to read and all of the stuff makes sense (to me, which is saying something)

\section{Other}
\label{sec-5}

\subsection{Page 6}
\label{sec-5-1}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Gene level variation in metagenomes
\label{sec-5-1-0-1}
This section is really nice as it uses brackets to refer to stuff. 
It's just a bit of contrast to some other sections of the paper, where there is some lack of clarification. 
It goes from talking about the metahaplome with no explanation to saying that DNA sequences are reads?
