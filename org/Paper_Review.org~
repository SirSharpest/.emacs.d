* I recognize but not 100% understand (AKA squishy bio-stuff) 
+ Haplotypes (I assume this is a pretty straightforward thing for most biologists though right?) 

* What is this? (AKA stuff I haven't heard off)
+ Nucleotide

+ Haplotype (I put this in twice because it's mentioned so much and changed what I thought I knew and is mentioned in more detail after a while)

* Grammar? 

** Page 5 
**** Diversity present in the enzymes and small petides in microbial communities ... 
This entire sentence is a little awkward to read, something more like: 
"Diversity in the enzymes and small petides found in microbial communities are a valuable... "

** Page 6 
**** The problem of haplotype discover ... is a post-assembly problem 
Could be worded better, feels odd to read

**** There's a [?] that has no references yet to software that can perform these functions

** page 8
There's a few areas on this page that have "..." sections that I don't really understand these areas :s 
But I assume this is because they're unfinished so no need to worry 

 
* General thoughts
I might be wrong, but doesn't anything between two ',' need to not be a requirement for the before and after parts of the sentence? 

** Page 5
+ About midway through the page there is a bit about assembly of reads from metagenomes, another thing I'm most likely wrong about / 
misunderstanding but it isn't clear if creating a reference from a metagenome refers to making one metagenomic sample a reference for other
unique samples or does the sample be used for itself? 

** Page 6
+ Gene-level variation in genomes... the margin of error given for contigs, is it worth giving a % example here of the kind of accuracy you aim for regularly? 
Especially if it is a low % it would be good to have more figures! 

+ Last sentence "Most existing haplotyping... for single-species" isn't this a little bit repeated with what's written a few paragraphs ago 
"Most assemblers are designed for single species genomes ... and aim to produce a single sequence". Might be worth while rewording slightly just to 
avoid sounding like repeating. I do realise it's slightly different but sounds very similar.  

** Page 8 
+ Is it worth while expanding upon / reworking the P(h1, h2 | M) so that it's easier to read? 
All the data is there for the function but has explanation before and after? I could just be nitt picky on this 

+ Maybe I missed something but last paragraph talks about "Wang" but there doesn't seem to be a mention of them before or decent explanation of their work.
Good chance that I'm wrong about this so perfectly happy for you to tell me I'm wrong on this

*** More recent methods... 
This section is really nice to read and all of the stuff makes sense (to me, which is saying something)

**** Gene level variation in metagenomes
This section is really nice as it uses brackets to refer to stuff. 
It's just a bit of contrast to some other sections of the paper, where there is some lack of clarification. 
It goes from talking about the metahaplome with no explanation to saying that DNA sequences are reads?
