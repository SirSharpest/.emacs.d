* Imaging with Matlab 

** 1. The beginning 

- http://uk.mathworks.com/ 
- Created in the late 70's 
- Horrifically slow 
- Just as a side note: Add ppa:octave/stable when using, as default 4.0.0 crashes on imgshow 

*** Octave is the GNU produced (free) Matlab-alike 
It can do almost everything that matlab can do. 

*** Software
- ImageJ: Java underlay
- OpenCV: C++ underlay 
- Matlab is its own language/environment 

*** Game plan 
- Get it working 
- Read and look at images 
- Colour and grey: simple segmentation 
- Manipulate color 

** 2. Octave images 

- Images are usually arrays of 8-bit quantities in the range of 0-255 
- Grey images are 2-dimensional 
- Color images are 3-dimensional 
- Otsu's histogram algorithm on bimodal histograms. 
- Tools: Mean, median, mode, var, std, sum, cumsum, sumsq help! 

** 3. More Image analysis 

- 'Good enough' is the general theme 
- Thresholding is a blunt instrument 
- Umpteen other segmentation approaches exit: adaptive 
- Thresholding operates selectively in local areas - what does 'local' then mean? 
- But often( usually?), precision in this task is simply unnecessary. A concept of good enough operates 
- This is important- inaccuarcy can be compensated by different algorithms 
*** IMPORTANT: Don't use for loops when can avoid it, us find function as it is the god function 
** 4. Imagine analysis cont. 

- Sometimes algorithms fail and that's okay
