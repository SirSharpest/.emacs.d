* Gravimetrics 
  
** TODO Look at hardware revamps 

There are various things that need done to make the hardware of Gravi suitable for expansion, 
these tasks should correct these issues and create solutions to them to be implemented in the redesign

*** TODO Look at better weight plates 

*** TODO Consider moving Pi's to local benches 

** TODO Rewrite Perl functionality in C/C++ 
*** TODO Make mySQL connection easily accessible 
**** TODO Write a SQL wrapper class 
*** TODO Decide on methods of data storage 

I'll have to look at the possiblity of storing data locally on each Pi as well as in the Database
or just have it all centralised
