* Gravimetrics 
  
** TODO Look at hardware revamps 

There are various things that need done to make the hardware of Gravi suitable for expansion, 
these tasks should correct these issues and create solutions to them to be implemented in the redesign

*** TODO Look at better weight plates 
    
For the weighing problem new more specialised plates may be required? 
    
**** DONE Contact PhenoSpex to ask about their system can measures dynamically to 1g

*** TODO Consider moving Pi's to local benches 

** TODO Rewrite Perl functionality in C/C++ 

*** TODO Fully think about how the program will be distributed/deployed on the Pi's 

My current thought is that they will have cronjobs from the master Pi which runs the program over SSH
and use a csv file (same as current, perhaps modify it for ease of use) on the local system as a parameter
 
*** TODO Make mySQL connection easily accessible 

**** TODO Write a SQL wrapper class 

***** TODO Make the SQL wrapper independant enough that it can be run independant if need be
      
Not 100% sure if it's wise to have several machines making their own connects to a database? 

*** TODO Decide on methods of data storage 

I'll have to look at the possiblity of storing data locally on each Pi as well as in the Database
or just have it all centralised

*** TODO Look at the C function stat() for sym link checking

Just a thought but I think that using the C program to determine what symbolic links it has access to
for the balances and the scales. [[http://linux.die.net/man/2/stat][Stat function link ]] 

*** TODO Look at something along the lines of  "$ cat file | ssh -e none remote-host 'cat > file'"
This command or something like it may be great for accessing the data on a specific Pi
