** Evolutionary approaches can be used to further understand complex microbiomes

*** Microbial communities 
+ Consitute about a thrid of the earths biomass
+ We don't know much about them 

**** Open questions: 
+ Are they static
+ Are species adapted to specific roles

*** Observations from Darwin
+ Population sizes would increase exponentially if all individuals survive 
+ Most populations are stable in size 

*** Gene selection
+ House keeping genes
  - Change is bad
+ Adaptive 
+ Selectively neutral genes
  - Genetic drift

**** Selections
+ Random genetic drift is random
+ Positive selection grows to 100% 

**** How do you detect positive selection? 
+ Dn - number of replacement subs 
+ Ds - Number of silent subs 

+ Dn/Ds > 1 -> Positive selection 

*** Microbes problem
+ They tend to have horizontal gene transfers 
+ They can adapt genes from other organisms 
+ For microbes it is easy to get copies of genes and replicate functions
